# -Wl,a,b,c means pass args "a b c" to linker ldd
# used ld --verbose -L$(pwd)/amazing_libs -lamazing_library to find why linker couldn't find it my own dumb naming
# object files and libs must be in dependency order ie. shove libs at end.

# need to look into why not rpath, just needed to provide linker with lib dir
# how would make a program s.t. requires to hook into lib at runtime? ie. using rpath?
